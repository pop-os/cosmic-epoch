- [ ] I have disclosed use of any AI generated code in my commit messages.
  - If you are using an LLM, and do not fully understand the changes it is making to the code base, do not create a PR.
  - In our experience, AI generated code often results in overly complex code that lacks enough context for a proper fix or feature inclusion. This results in considerably longer code reviews. Due to this, AI authored or partially authored PRs may be closed without comment.
- [ ] I understand these changes in full and will be able to respond to review comments.
- [ ] My change is accurately described in the commit message.
- [ ] My contribution is tested and working as described.
- [ ] I have read the [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org/) and certify my contribution under its conditions.
